# My Programming Journey
##### 2017:
- Tried to read Java for Dummies in the 7th grade, couldn't even set up Eclipse and declared programming was too hard ðŸ˜‚
##### 2022:
- Started my first year at Rutgers University, taking Intro CS and Linear Algebra
- Wrote a linear regression calculator in Java for a hackathon. Implemented all the math from scratch
##### 2023:
- Took DSA and Discrete Structures I
- Made an Obsidian-like note taking app with Electron, using pure JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Developed a competitive typing game with React and Node, deployed on Firebase. Implemented a MySQL database through Google Cloud SQL
    - On March 24, 2024 at 11:59 PM, my 90 day GCP free trial ran out... unfortunately marked the end of deployment :(
- Took Computer Architecture, Discrete Structures II, and Linear Programming
- Built an object detection based CAPTCHA system by training my own YOLOv4-tiny model. Made a customizable image augmentation pipeline
##### 2024:
- Took Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, Data Management with Python, and Databases
- Attempted to create a HMM POS tagger and a shift-reduce dependency parser from scratch (did not succeed haha)
- Developed a grammar checker by combining spaCy's dependency parser with rule-based systems. Created training pipelines for spaCy's POS tagger and dependency parser to enable custom grammar rules and multi-language support
    - Worked with two friends on this; led all parts of the research and development process
- Made this portfolio website you're looking at right now with Next.js
- Took Intro to Deep Learning and Principles of Programming Languages
