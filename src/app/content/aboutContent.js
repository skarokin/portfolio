"# My Programming Journey\n" +
"##### 2017:\n" +
"- Tried to read Java for Dummies in the 7th grade, couldn't even set up Eclipse and declared programming was too hard ðŸ˜‚\n" +
"##### 2022:\n" +
"- Started my first year at Rutgers University, taking Intro CS and Linear Algebra\n" +
"- Wrote a linear regression calculator in Java for a hackathon. Implemented all the math from scratch.\n" +
"##### 2023:\n" +
"- Took DSA and Discrete Structures I\n" +
"- Made an Obsidian-like note taking app with Electron, using pure JavaScript/HTML/CSS\n" +
"- Developed a competitive typing game with React and Node, deployed on Firebase. Implemented a MySQL database through Google Cloud SQL\n" +
"  - On March 24, 2024 at 11:59 PM, my 90 day GCP free trial ran out... unfortunately marked the end of deployment :(\n" +
"- Took Computer Architecture, Discrete Structures II, and Linear Programming\n" +
"- Built an object detection based CAPTCHA system by training my own YOLOv4-tiny model. Made a customizable image augmentation pipeline\n" +
"##### 2024:\n" +
"- Took Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, Data Management with Python, and Databases\n" +
"- Did 3 months of research on POS tagging and dependency parsing. Attempted to create a HMM POS tagger from scratch and a shift-reduce dependency parser from scratch... miserably failed both\n" +
"- Developed a grammar checker by combining spaCy's dependency parser with rule-based systems. Created training pipelines for spaCy's POS tagger and dependency parser to enable custom grammar rules and multi-language support\n" +
"  - Worked with two friends on this; led all parts of the research and development process\n" +
"- Made this portfolio website you're looking at right now with Next.js\n" +
"- Took Intro to Deep Learning and Principles of Programming Languages\n" +
