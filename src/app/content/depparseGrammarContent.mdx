### Python, spaCy, React, Firebase
- A customizable grammar checker that combines a dependency parser with rule-based systems.
- Leverages spaCy training pipelines to support multiple languages and custom grammar rules.
- Inspired by [this](https://mmozgovoy.dev/papers/mozgovoy11b.pdf) research paper.

### Blog
- Started out as random research on HMMs, which led me to HMMs for POS tagging.
- Came up with an idea to use an HMM for grammar checking, realized there was a major flaw in my plan.
- Discovery of major flaw led me to find out about dependency parsers. Did a whole bunch of research on them and wanted to make one from scratch.
- Decided to use an existing one for grammar checking. Played around with spaCy's dependency parser and realized it was bad at ungrammatical sentences.
- Found the research paper linked above, got in touch with the researcher and got a lot of helpful insight.
- Got OntoNotes 5.0 corpus but realized it was in PTB not CoNLL-U.
- Spent 2 weeks trying to get an old PTB to CoNLL-U script working then found out that Stanford had an actively maintained converter...
- Finally converted! But it took forever lol... realized that when converting CoNLL-U to spaCy binary I should definitely multithread (this was pretty simple since it was just a list of command line scripts).
