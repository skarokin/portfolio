                            &nbsp; I love animanga, am the IGL for a Valorant team, and help coach my high school&apos;s Esports team <br/>
                            &nbsp; I&apos;ve done 7 coast-to-coast road trips and have visited almost every major national park<br/>
                            &nbsp; I lived in Oregon from 2018-2019 <br/>
                            &nbsp; In 2018, I heard an Aimer song for the first time in an anime ending... she&apos;s been my favorite artist ever since <br/>
                            &nbsp; In 2021, I started learning Japanese (mainly just to understand Aimer lyrics) <br/>
                            &nbsp; In 2022, I started going to the gym and fell in love with health and fitness <br/>
